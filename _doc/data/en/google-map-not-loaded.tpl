<h2>Why Google Map doesn't work?</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you might have an issue with Google Map saying the following</p>
<pre>
    Oops! Something went wrong.
    This page didn't load Google Maps correctly. See the JavaScript console for technical details.
</pre>
<p>This happend when your domain is new and has never used Google Map prior June 22nd, 2016.</p>
<p>Google Map recently changed its TOS and requires now an API key. So pH7CMS 2.0 and newer allows you to add a Gogole API key.</p>
<p>To do it, go to your admin panel -> Settings -> Google Map API</p>
<p>We cannot do anything for that, you will just have to move your site to a domain that respects the TOS of Google Map's service</p>
